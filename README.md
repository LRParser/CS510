1) Meta-QSAR: a large-scale application of meta-learning to drug design and discovery  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03854

Summary: Meta-learning is the process of building an ML model which, when input a dataset, looks at features of this dataset such as entropy, number of samples, etc. and will then give info as to 'which algo' would perform the best. 

The authors note QSAR learning is one of the most important and established applications of machine  learning.  We  demonstrate  that  meta-learning  can  be  leveraged  to build  QSAR  models  which  are  much  better  than  those  learned  with  any base-level regression algorithm"

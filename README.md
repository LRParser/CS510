## Overview

This is the repo for our CS510 project group, focused on applications of AI to the drug discovery process

## Relevant articles

1) Meta-QSAR: a large-scale application of meta-learning to drug design and discovery  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03854

Summary: Meta-learning is the process of building an ML model which, when input a dataset, looks at features of this dataset such as entropy, number of samples, etc. and will then give info as to 'which algo' would perform the best. 

The authors note QSAR learning is one of the most important and established applications of machine  learning.  We  demonstrate  that  meta-learning  can  be  leveraged  to build  QSAR  models  which  are  much  better  than  those  learned  with  any base-level regression algorithm"

They add their dataset under "learning how to learn QSARs"
https://www.openml.org/s/13

2) Learning Graph-Level Representation for Drug Discovery - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.03741.pdf

Interesting notes - they "adopt focal  loss(Lin  et  al.  2017)
and  show  that  it  can  effectively  improve  the  classification
performance in unbalanced molecular dataset."

3) Generating Focussed Molecule Libraries for Drug Discovery with Recurrent Neural Networks - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01329
4) Low Data Drug Discovery with One-shot Learning - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03199
